Coursera LAMP Notifications
======================

Dear, 
 
By searching through the web we have noticed that your GitHub accounts contain the solutions for assignments in the courses Principles of Reactive Programming and Functional Programming Principles in Scala.
 
Making these solutions public allows future students to use them as theirs. This puts students that are fair and dedicated in an unfair position. Furthermore, the effort invested in the assignments and their grading is significant and making a new batch of assignments every year is hardly achievable. Therefore publishing the solutions makes it hard for us to make this course exist.
 
To prevent this unfair situation the LAMP Coursera Team would kindly ask you to remove all your solutions from the publicly accessible websites. Thanks for understanding. 
 
Sincerely, 
The LAMP Coursera Team
